# Keypoints Extractor UI

This project provides a user interface for extracting keypoints from audio/video files. It allows users to upload files, process them to extract transcriptions and key points, and view the results in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

-   **File Upload**: Supports uploading audio and video files in various formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, AVI).
-   **Transcription**: Automatically transcribes the audio from the uploaded file using Speech-to-Text technology.
-   **Key Points Extraction**: Extracts key points or a summary from the transcription using NLP techniques.
-   **User Interface**: Presents the transcription and key points in a clear and organized manner, allowing for easy review and analysis.
-   **Processing Status**: Provides real-time feedback on the processing status of the uploaded file, including transcription and key point extraction progress.
-   **Download Results**: Allows users to download the transcription and key points in various formats (e.g., TXT, JSON).

## Technologies Used

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   **React Hot Toast**: For displaying toast notifications.
-   **Lucide React**: For icons.
-   **Vite**: Build tool.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: CSS framework.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the UI on `http://localhost:5173`. Make sure your backend server is running as well.
    The backend code is in ```https://github.com/AbhiYellapu/keypoints-extractor-server```

## Configuration

The UI expects the backend server to be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. This can be configured in `src/lib/api.ts`.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

-   `API_BASE_URL`: The URL of the backend API.  Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
